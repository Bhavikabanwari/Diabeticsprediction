Improving early diabetes detection is the goal of the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) in order to improve patient outcomes. Our business goal is to determine the probability of diabetes based on diagnostic measurements by building prediction models with a carefully selected dataset. Our business objective revolves around employing these models to contribute to proactive and targeted healthcare interventions.
